app-ROI2ROI_track fits CSD model to input DWI data and performs tracking based on ROIs provided by user. Tracking is employing following tools and methods: Anatomically Constrained Tractography (ACT), Ensemble Tractography (ET) and iFOD2 tracking algorithm. Although script was designed primarily to perform optimal tracking in Optic Chiasm, the script can be used for any set of starting/ending/exclusion/inclusion ROIs.

Input:
1) DWI files
2) coregisterred anatomy
3) 5TT image obtained from anatomy (optional)
4) Set of starting ROIs
5) Set of ending ROIs
6) Set of inclusion ROIs
7) Set of exclsion ROIs
8) Set of parameters
