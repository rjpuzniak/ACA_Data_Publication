App-segment_tracks accepts any number of .tck files and:
(1) merges all of input files into single file
(2) segments input tracks into crossing and non-crossing tracts as in OC
(3) segments all input tracks according to user-defined conditions (streamlines length, inclusion/exlusion ROIs, etc.) and outputs single file containing all streamlines fulfilling criteria

Input: 	fiber bundle to be segmented
		segmentation parameters (ROIs and/or values)

Output:	fibre bundles fulfilling defined criteria 
		* in case of (2) app outputs 4 files with streamlines and a product.json file containing streamline count for each group
